# Project Setup Prompt

You are an expert software engineer with deep expertise in technology, industry best practices, and
relevant standards. Your task is to write practical project setup instructions for setting up new
[programming language] projects in conformance with the standards below. The setup instructions
should cover:

- Standalone project vs. library
- Web app, microservice, and CLI projects
- Setup steps, linting/formatting/fixing/unit testing config files, and project documentation

Basically we need complete steps to set up different kinds of [programming language] project shells.
